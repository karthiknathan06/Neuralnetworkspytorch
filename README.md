#Pytorch
Features based on pytorch documentation
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group, and Uber's "Pyro" software for probabilistic programming is built on it.

PyTorch enables fast, flexible experimentation and efficient production through a hybrid front-end, distributed training, and ecosystem of tools and libraries.

#HYBRID FRONT-END
A new hybrid front-end provides ease-of-use and flexibility in eager mode, while seamlessly transitioning to graph mode for speed, optimization, and functionality in C++ runtime environments.

#DISTRIBUTED TRAINING
Optimize performance in both research and production by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution of collective operations and peer-to-peer communication that is accessible from Python and C++.

PYTHON-FIRST
PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework. Itâ€™s built to be deeply integrated into Python so it can be used with popular libraries and packages such as Cython and Numba.

NATIVE ONNX SUPPORT
Export models in the standard ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format for direct access to ONNX-compatible platforms, runtimes, visualizers

C++ FRONT-END
The C++ frontend is a pure C++ interface to PyTorch that follows the design and architecture of the established Python frontend. It is intended to enable research in high performance, low latency and bare metal C++ applications.

Here i have used google colab jupyter notebook for processing
